### What is UniPlan?

UniPlan is envisioned as an all-in-one term planner for post-secondary students, allowing for easy management of course data, assignment deadlines, scheduling and grade projection, among other things.

   It is intended to allow for accurate and simplified planning data input, providing users with the tools to set up a comprehensive and logical work schedule without requiring redundant data input.
