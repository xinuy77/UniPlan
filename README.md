### What is UniPlan?
UniPlan is envisioned as an all-in-one term planner for post-secondary students, allowing for easy management of course data, assignment deadlines, scheduling and grade projection, among other things. It is intended to allow for accurate and simplified planning data input, providing users with the tools to set up a comprehensive and logical work schedule without requiring redundant data input.   

UniPlan’s utility is manifold: firstly, assuming that the user has access to all course information at the start of the semester, this would allow the user to generate a reasonably comprehensive term plan within a single session. Secondly, the calendar interface will allow the user to input additional details to create a mores specialized schedule outside of important deadlines. Thirdly, its availability on a mobile platform will allow for ease of access to all the aggregate information required to maintain and adjust a comprehensive work schedule. Lastly, its ability to project the student’s final grade in each course will assist the user in prioritizing work on upcoming tests and assignments.
